## Jon G's README

👋 My name is Jon Goldberg and I'm the Director of Analytics Enablement Services at The Hartford.

* 📫 [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nescient/)


👀 Here are some things about me:

* I am a philosophy major with a passion for Data and Anaylics.
* I am a continual learner and enjoy diving into new technologies or domains whether it be in the data/analytics space or on other topics like communication and leadership.
* I believe in the [servant-leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) model. Management is a specialty like Frontend, Backend, Security, or DevOps. And that means aptitude comes with an imperative to make others' around you better by this skill. There is no prestige in reporting lines: your manager should be whomever makes you most effective, regardless of level.
* Emotionally, I never get too high, or too low. A strength is I never have 'hair-on-fire' moments. A weakness is that I could be better at the inspirational style of motivation that comes from stirring speeches, and whatnot. I commonly hear that I am 'difficult to read'. You're likely overthinking it: just take me at face value.
* I value communication more than most engineering leaders. It's the mortar between the bricks that allows us to build massive projects
* My email inbox is my to do list. Everything gets read, actioned, answered, and archived. 100% SLA.
* I always keep my promises. And I greatly value people that do the same. I sometimes wonder if those who gracefully let the tail-end of their backlog slip through the cracks are more effective and efficient, but I can't bring myself to allow that to happen
* I come from a non-traditional engineering background. I studied Philosophy in college and programmed on the side. Nevertheless, I went back and painted in my skill set with computer science fundamentals. I recommend that all self-taught programmers do the same.
* Outside of work I love rock climbing, reading, and spending time with my family.
* I type too fast and make spelling/grammatical mistakes where there isn't a native spell checker. I'm working on it. 😁
