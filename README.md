## Jon G's README

👋 My name is Jon Goldberg and I'm the Director of Analytics Enablement Services at The Hartford.

* 📫 [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nescient/)


👀 Here are some things about me:


* I am a continual learner and enjoy diving into new technologies or domains whether it be in the data/analytics space or on other topics like communication and leadership.
* I believe in the [servant-leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) model as well as [extreme ownership](https://calvinrosser.com/notes/extreme-ownership-summary/). 
* Emotionally, I never get too high, or too low. A strength is I never have 'hair-on-fire' moments. 
* I value communication more than most engineering leaders. It something I continue to work to refine for myself and promote among my team.
* I quickly triage and organize requests using timeblocks as reminders/to-do's so I stay on top of things.
* If I commit to something I'll get it done.
* I come from a non-traditional data and analytics background. I studied Philosophy in college and got a data and analytics job for my first role out of college. Since then I've continued to develop my skillset on the job as well as by reading books on fundamentals/best practices and getting my masters in Business Analytics.
* Outside of work I love rock climbing, reading, and spending time with my family.
* I type too fast and make spelling/grammatical mistakes where there isn't a native spell checker. I'm working on it. 😁
